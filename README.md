# Coding-Quiz-HW

This is a simple quiz built with HTML and Javascript. When the user clicks the start button, a timer will start and they will be asked several multiple choice questions in sequence, which they will answer by clicking the correct button. If the user clicks an incorrect button, the time will decrease by a set amount. When the user has answered all the questions, they will be prompted to input an alias to save their score. They can check the leaderboards at any time by clicking the show scores button.
